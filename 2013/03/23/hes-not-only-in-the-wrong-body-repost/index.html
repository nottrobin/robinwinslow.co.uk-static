<h2 id="why-repost?">Why repost?</h2>

<p>The Daily Mail have since removed the article and <a href="http://www.seologic.com/webmaster-tools/url-redirect?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fdebate%2Farticle-2251347%2FNathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">redirected its URL to a different article</a>.</p>

<p>I believe in open and uncensored access to information, even for controversial content, and since I found it so hard to find the contents of this article (I eventually found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">it on archive.org</a>), I&#39;m reposting it here to help someone else find it.</p>

<h2 id="my-position">My position</h2>

<p>In case you&#39;re interested in my position on the whole thing: I completely disagree with Littlejohn&#39;s position against transgender teachers, but I also believe in his right to express his opinion - he wasn&#39;t overly offensive or vitriolic. I think it&#39;s extremely unfortunate that Lucy Meadows committed suicide and I feel very sorry for Lucy Meadows but also for Richard Littlejohn who&#39;s life must be horrible right now.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here&#39;s the article (minus images and captions), pasted from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">archive.org</a></p>

<h1 id="the-article">The article</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s not only in the wrong body... he&#39;s in the wrong job</p>

<p>Look, it can&#39;t be much fun being a woman trapped in a man&#39;s body. Believe me, ladies, there are times when it&#39;s not exactly a bundle of laughs being a man trapped inside a man&#39;s body.</p>

<p>So I have every sympathy for the 400 or so people a year who opt for &#39;gender reassignment&#39; surgery to put themselves out of their misery. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have any problem with sex-change operations being carried out on the NHS, provided it&#39;s a genuine medical necessity and not a lifestyle choice. Transsexuals pay taxes, too.</p>

<p>Schoolteacher Nathan Upton, 32, says he always knew he was born into the wrong sex. Yet he married and fathered a child, now aged three. It was only fairly recently that he decided to go public with his inner turmoil.</p>

<p>The first indications came when he began growing his cropped hair and dyeing it purple. He started turning up for class wearing pink nail varnish and sparkly headbands.</p>

<p>His pupils at St Mary Magdalen&#39;s Church of England Primary School in Accrington, Lancs, couldn&#39;t help noticing. A crayon drawing of Mr Upton by a Year 6 pupil on the school&#39;s website shows him with long hair swept back over his shoulders.</p>

<p>One parent said: &#39;I saw what I thought was Mr Upton dressed as a woman in town one weekend, but I decided I had imagined it.&#39;</p>

<p>Oh no, you hadn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Confirmation came in the school&#39;s Christmas newsletter. It started innocuously enough, with a series of routine staff announcements. Then in paragraph six, out of the blue, BOOM! Are you sitting comfortably, children?</p>

<p>&#39;Mr Upton has made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman after the Christmas  break. She will return to work as Miss Meadows.&#39;</p>

<p>It went on to stress that the school is &#39;proud of our commitment to equality and diversity&#39;. Of course they are.</p>

<p>This week, the school&#39;s 169 pupils, aged between seven and 11, were informed class-by-class that from now on, &#39;Sir&#39; would be &#39;Miss&#39;. </p>

<p>Teachers told them that Mr Upton felt he had been &#39;born with a girl&#39;s brain in a boy&#39;s body&#39; and would henceforth be living as a woman.</p>

<p>Nathan Upton is now in the early stages of gender reassignment treatment. He issued a statement which read: &#39;This has been a long and difficult journey for me and it was certainly not an easy decision to make.&#39;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s all right, then. From now on, kiddies, Mr Upton will be known as Miss Lucy Meadows. </p>

<p>What are you staring at, Johnny? Move along, nothing to see here. Get on with your spelling test. Today&#39;s word is &#39;transitioning&#39;.</p>

<p>Mr Upton/Miss Meadows may well be comfortable with his/her decision to seek a sex-change and return to work as if nothing has happened. The school might be extremely proud of its &#39;commitment to equality and diversity&#39;.</p>

<p>But has anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren&#39;t equipped to compute this kind of information.</p>

<p>Pre-pubescent boys and girls haven&#39;t even had the chance to come to terms with the changes in their own bodies.</p>

<p>Why should they be forced to deal with the news that a male teacher they have always known as Mr Upton will henceforth be a woman called Miss Meadows? Anyway, why not Miss Upton?</p>

<p>Parent Wayne Cowie said the news had left his ten-year-old son worried and confused.</p>

<p>For the past three years he has been taught by Mr Upton, but has now been told that he will be punished if he continues to call &#39;Miss Meadows&#39; &#39;Mr Upton&#39; after the Christmas holidays. &#39;My middle boy thinks that he might wake up with a girl&#39;s brain because he was told that Mr Upton, as he got older, got a girl&#39;s brains.&#39;</p>

<p>The school shouldn&#39;t be allowed to elevate its &#39;commitment to diversity and equality&#39; above its duty of care to its pupils and their parents. </p>

<p>It should be protecting pupils from some of the more, er, challenging realities of adult life, not forcing them down their throats.</p>

<p>These are primary school children, for heaven&#39;s sake. Most them still believe in Father Christmas. Let them enjoy their childhood. They will lose their innocence soon enough.</p>

<p>The head teacher denies that pupils will be punished for referring to the teacher as Mr Upton but added ominously that they would be &#39;expected to behave properly around her.&#39; Nathan Upton is entitled to his gender reassignment surgery, but he isn&#39;t entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.</p>

<p>By insisting on returning to St Mary Magdalen&#39;s, he is putting his own selfish needs ahead of the well-being of the children he has taught for the past few years.</p>

<p>It would have been easy for him to disappear quietly at Christmas, have the operation and then return to work as &#39;Miss Meadows&#39; at another school on the other side of town in September. No-one would have been any the wiser.</p>

<p>But if he cares so little for the sensibilities of the children he is paid to teach, he&#39;s not only trapped in the wrong body, he&#39;s in the wrong job.</p>
