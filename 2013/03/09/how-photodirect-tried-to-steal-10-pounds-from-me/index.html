        <h1>DSR &amp; how photodirect tried to steal &pound;10</h1>
        <date>09 Mar 2013</date>
    </header>
    
    <p>I feel like I&#39;ve been having a lot of arguments with companies lately.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I bought an iPad from <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=photodirect">PhotoDirect on eBay</a> as a birthday present for my girlfriend and on Wednesday it arrived (wonderful service).</p>

<h1 id="ipad-browsing-problems">iPad browsing problems</h1>

<p>However, then we realised that my girlfriend&#39;s core online learning resource - <a href="http://e-lfh.org.uk">e-learning for healthcare</a>
- doesn&#39;t work on an iPad (incidentally it works fine on <a href="http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/">Jelly Bean</a> but that&#39;s another story).</p>

<h1 id="returning-an-ipad">Returning an iPad</h1>

<p>So on Friday (2 days after it arrived) I sent an eBay message to PhotoDirect asking to return the item, polite as you like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hi. I just bought a white iPad 2 from you. it arrived on Wednesday.<br>
it was a present for my girlfriend, but she&#39;s discovered that the main thing she wanted to do on it it won&#39;t work for.<br>
can I send it back and get a full refund? the packaging hasn&#39;t been opened.</p>

<p>-- <cite>nottrobin</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anticipating a struggle, as soon as I sent this message I googled and read up on my consumer rights.</p>

<p>They responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting us.<br>
Is it still as we sent? Sealed?</p>

<p>-- <cite>photodirect</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Ignore that I&#39;d clearly said &quot;the packaging hasn&#39;t been opened&quot; - this isn&#39;t the point)</p>

<h1 id="misunderstandings">Misunderstandings</h1>

<p>This is where I communicated terribly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I opened the outer cardboard box. the actual iPad packaging is untouched and still in it&#39;s cellophane wrapping.</p>

<p>-- <cite>nottrobin</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see from my second reply there that she might have thought I had opened the iPad&#39;s manufacturer box (I hadn&#39;t), 
which led to...</p>

<h1 id="the-part-where-they-try-to-steal-£10">The part where they try to steal £10</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting us.
When you broke the seal , we can&#39;t sell it as Brand new again so we can refund your payment minus 10GBP .</p>

<p>-- <cite>photodirect</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just want to clarify that In may case there is absolutely no cause for them
to complain because I didn&#39;t actually open the manufacturer box. This is a matter of principle.</p>

<p>Here is where it gets interesting / infuriating. They just <strong>broke the law</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. the UK Distance Selling Regulations state that you must allow me to return the item for a full refund, even if I have opened it (with exceptions that don&#39;t included iPads) - I have the right to inspect the item and still cancel the order if I wish.</p>

<p>-- <cite>nottrobin</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="consumer-rights---the-distance-selling-regulations">Consumer rights - the Distance Selling Regulations</h1>

<p>I think this point is really important. The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2334/contents/made">UK Distance Selling Regulations</a> mean that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your right to cancel starts the moment you place your order and doesn’t end until seven working days from the day after you receive your goods.</p>

<p>-- <cite><a href="http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/distance-selling-regulations/#link-2">Which?</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right means that you can inspect a product exactly as you would expect to be able to in a shop
- and <strong>that means opening the package</strong> - and still send it back for a full refund.</p>

<h1 id="further-attempts-to-infringe-on-consumer-rights">Further attempts to infringe on consumer rights</h1>

<p>Once I&#39;d got them to agree to give me a refund, they sent me an email containing instructions on how to send it back to them.
This email contained the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. Please make sure that the item does not have any physical or user related damage.
Any problems related to user fault will be refused.</p>

<p>-- <cite>photodirect</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, this threat is <strong>against the law</strong>. As shown above,
a distance retailer <strong>does not have the right</strong> to refuse to give me a
refund as long as I wish to cancel the order within 7 days of receiving it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. even if the customer fails to take reasonable care of the goods, they still have a right to cancel and receive a full refund.
However, you may have a claim for damages against them.</p>

<p>-- <cite><a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/business-advice/treating-customers-fairly/dshome/inpractice/?id=808330">The Office of Fair Trading</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="this-is-important">This is important</h1>

<p>Fortunately for me I am the sort of person who will look up my rights in situations like this.</p>

<p>Lots of other people don&#39;t have the time or the inclination,
and probably the socially dis-empowered are the least likely to do so.</p>

<p>In this situation, photodirect could have got away with stealing from them by not giving them a full refund.
That is why I think this is important, and why I think this was particularly disgusting behaviour on the part of photodirect.</p>
