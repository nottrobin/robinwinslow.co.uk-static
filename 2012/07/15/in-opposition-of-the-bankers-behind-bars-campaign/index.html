        <h1>In opposition of the "Bankers behind bars" campaign</h1>
        <date>15 Jul 2012</date>
    </header>
    
    <p>Avaaz recently ran a campaign called &quot;<a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/bankers_behind_bars_g/">bankers behind bars</a>&quot;. While I
agree with many Avaaz campaigns, this particular one goes against
everything I believe in. I sent them an email.</p>

<p>Actually my email purports to be offering some suggestions for adding
credibility to Avaaz campaigns, which is something I genuinely think,
but I admit it was just a frame for my opposition to the one campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To start with the effect of Avaaz petitions was powerful because you
could amass hundreds of thousands, or sometimes millions, of signatures
on an issue.</p>

<p>However, as time goes on more and more of these petitions exist, and now
100k signatures on an online petition isn&#39;t anything impressive.</p>

<p>Ways in which you could show just how important certain petitions are to
people include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a page comparing how quickly signatures were generated for the different petitions, to see which perform better.</li>
<li>Allowing people to vote either way in a petition, so you can see how many Avaaz members actually disagree with a petition.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, while I support most of Avaaz&#39;s campaigns, and I am as
staunch a supporter of financial reform as you&#39;re likely to find, I
cannot condone pushing for bankers to be imprisoned. This goes against
everything I believe in. By all means shine a light on the practices in
banks and shame those involved and make sure they never are in a
position to cause such harm again. Examine the causes of the toxic
culture and regulate against it. That would all be wonderful.</p>

<p>BUT what will seeking to punish those involved with imprisonment
achieve? They don&#39;t need to be imprisoned for the protection of society,
as making sure they are not allowed to be bankers any more is not a
difficult thing to achieve, so punishment can be the only goal.</p>

<p>Imprisoning Bob Diamond may scare other banking bosses into being
slightly more responsible with our money (although I&#39;m not convinced 
that&#39;s necessarily true) but do you really want to encourage defining 
society through fear? The real solution to the banking crisis is through 
regulation, transparency and promoting a culture of equality, not through 
punishing the constituents of the broken system.</p>

<p>Sorry went off on a bit of a tangent there. The bottom line is - I would
have more respect for Avaaz as an organisation if there was a mechanism
whereby, as an Avaaz member, I could express my opposition to a
campaign.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>
